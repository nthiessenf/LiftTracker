# LiftTrack - Project Context & System Prompts

## 1. Project Overview
**LiftTrack** is a "Local First" React Native mobile application designed for planning, logging, and tracking gym workouts.
* **Core Philosophy:** 100% offline capability, zero latency, privacy-focused.
* **Key Mechanic:** Emphasizes progressive overload by referencing past performance during active sessions.
* **User Status:** The user is a non-technical Product Manager using Cursor AI to build the app.

## 2. Tech Stack
* **Framework:** React Native (Managed Workflow via Expo SDK ~54)
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Navigation:** Expo Router (File-based routing)
* **Styling:** NativeWind (Tailwind CSS for React Native)
* **Data (Content):** `expo-sqlite` (Routines, Workouts, Sets)
* **Data (Prefs):** `AsyncStorage` (Simple settings like Weekly Goals, Onboarding flags)
* **Visualization:** 
  * `react-native-circular-progress-indicator` (Weekly Goal Ring)
  * `react-native-body-highlighter` (Muscle Recovery Heatmap)
  * `react-native-calendars` (History Calendar View)

## 3. Data Architecture (CRITICAL)
The app uses a **Hybrid Data Model**. You must understand where data lives to write correct code.

### A. Static Data (Code)
* **Source:** `data/exercises.ts`
* **Purpose:** Contains definitions (Names, Muscle Groups, Instructions, `primary_focus`).
* **Note:** There is **NO** exercises table in the DB. The DB stores string references (`exercise_id`) which are looked up in this file.

### B. Dynamic Data (SQLite)
* **Source:** Local SQLite Database (`routines`, `routine_exercises`, `workouts`, `sets` tables).
* **Purpose:** Stores user-created routines, logs, and history.
* **Migration Status:** As of Jan 2026, the app uses a "Pure SQLite" architecture. Hardcoded JSON templates have been removed.

### C. Database Schema
```sql
-- Table: routines
-- Stores user-defined workout plans.
CREATE TABLE routines (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  updated_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_temporary INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

-- Table: routine_exercises
-- Links exercises to routines.
CREATE TABLE routine_exercises (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  routine_id TEXT NOT NULL,        -- FK to routines
  exercise_id TEXT NOT NULL,       -- String Ref to data/exercises.ts
  order_index INTEGER NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (routine_id) REFERENCES routines(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Table: workouts
-- History of completed sessions.
CREATE TABLE workouts (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  date TEXT NOT NULL,              -- ISO String (YYYY-MM-DD)
  name TEXT,
  duration_seconds INTEGER,
  routine_id TEXT                  -- FK to routines (Added in Migration v2)
);

-- Table: sets
-- Individual performance logs.
CREATE TABLE sets (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  workout_id TEXT NOT NULL,        -- FK to workouts
  exercise_id TEXT NOT NULL,       -- String Ref to data/exercises.ts
  weight REAL,
  reps REAL,
  completed INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,  -- Boolean (0 or 1)
  timestamp TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY (workout_id) REFERENCES workouts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

**Key Points:**
* All IDs are `TEXT` (not INTEGER) - typically timestamp-based strings
* `exercise_id` is a string reference to `data/exercises.ts`, NOT a foreign key
* `is_temporary` flag distinguishes user-created routines from auto-generated ones
* Migrations are handled in `data/database/db.ts` via `migrateDbIfNeeded()`

## 4. Operational Rules for AI Assistant

### Precise Prompts
When generating code, provide step-by-step application instructions. Reference specific file paths and imports.

### Offline First
Never suggest Firebase, Supabase, or remote APIs. All features must work without internet.

### Data Safety
Always respect the "Source of Truth." Do not hardcode new routines in JSON; insert them into SQLite.

### Navigation Logic
* **Dashboard (index.tsx):** Reviews status and "Up Next" recommendation
* **Workouts (workouts.tsx):** Routine library and selection
* **Library (library.tsx):** Exercise reference knowledge
* **History (history.tsx):** Reflect on past performance

### Code Style
* **ALWAYS use functional components** (never class components)
* **NEVER leave the app in a broken state**
* Use TypeScript types consistently
* Follow existing patterns for database queries and state management

## 5. Current Feature Status (Jan 2026)

### Dashboard (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`)
* Green "Goal Ring" tracks weekly workouts with streak counter
* "Up Next" card rotates based on routine_id index (no longer string matching)
* Handles "Zero State" gracefully without crashing
* Weekly Progress dots show workout status for current week
* **Note:** Body heatmap feature was removed in recent refactoring

### Active Session (`app/session/active.tsx`)
* Smart Pre-fill: Queries SQLite for the last session of that specific exercise to fill weight/reps
* Saves `routine_id` to history to maintain lineage
* Supports temporary routines (can be saved after completion)
* Rest timer functionality

### Library (`app/(tabs)/library.tsx`)
* Hybrid view: Shows static instructions + MAX(weight) from history
* Exercise detail view (`app/library/[id].tsx`) shows Personal Records
* Category filtering

### History (`app/(tabs)/history.tsx`)
* Calendar view with marked workout days
* Fully editable. Users can add new exercises to past workouts
* Workout detail view (`app/history/[id].tsx`) allows editing sets

### Routines (`app/routines/`)
* Create routine (`create.tsx`): Template gallery + manual exercise selection
* Routine detail (`detail/[id].tsx`): Preview exercises before starting
* Routine deletion with confirmation

### Onboarding (`app/onboarding.tsx`)
* Uses `HAS_COMPLETED_ONBOARDING` in AsyncStorage to prevent loops
* Sets weekly workout goal

### Backup (`data/services/backupService.ts`)
* JSON Export/Import (Restore) is fully functional
* Includes `routine_exercises` table in exports

## 7. Important Functions & Helpers

### Database Helpers (`data/database/db.ts`)
* `migrateDbIfNeeded()` - Handles schema migrations
* `getLastTrainedDateByMuscleGroup()` - Returns muscle recovery dates
* `getRoutineDurationEstimate()` - Calculates estimated workout time
* `generateSmartRoutine()` - Creates routine based on muscle freshness
* `createEmptyRoutine()` - Creates blank session template
* `cleanupTemporaryRoutines()` - Removes auto-generated routines
* `deleteRoutine()` - Cascading delete for routines

### Exercise Data (`data/exercises.ts`)
* `EXERCISES` array contains all exercise definitions
* Each exercise has: `id`, `name`, `muscleGroup`, `primary_focus`, `targetReps`
* `primary_focus` is used for muscle recovery tracking

## 8. Design Principles

### Dark Mode Default
* Background: `#121212` (main), `#1e1e1e` (cards)
* Borders: `#2a2a2a`
* Primary Accent: `#10b981` (green)
* Text: `#E5E5E5` (primary), `#999` (secondary)

### Minimalist UI
* Clean, uncluttered layouts
* Consistent spacing (`paddingHorizontal: 24`, `marginBottom: 24-48`)
* Card-based design with subtle borders and shadows

### Accessibility
* Touch targets minimum 44px height
* Clear visual hierarchy
* Readable font sizes

## 9. Common Patterns

### Loading Data
```typescript
useFocusEffect(
  useCallback(() => {
    loadData();
  }, [loadData])
);
```

### Database Queries
```typescript
const db = useSQLiteContext();
const results = await db.getAllAsync<Type>('SELECT ...', [params]);
```

### AsyncStorage
```typescript
await AsyncStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
const value = await AsyncStorage.getItem('key');
```

### Navigation
```typescript
router.push({ pathname: '/route', params: { id: '123' } });
```

## 10. Troubleshooting Notes

* **Onboarding Loop:** Check `HAS_COMPLETED_ONBOARDING` flag in AsyncStorage
* **Missing Data:** Verify migrations have run (`PRAGMA user_version`)
* **Temporary Routines:** Check `is_temporary = 1` flag in routines table
* **Exercise Lookups:** Always reference `data/exercises.ts`, never query DB for exercises
